'''1.	Lets say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list b 
that has only the even elements of this list in it. (Use filter and lambda)'''
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 ==0, a))
print(b)
