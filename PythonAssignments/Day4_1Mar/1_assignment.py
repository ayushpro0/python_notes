# 1.	Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: 
# a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 

# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a
# new list b that has only the even elements of this list in it.


arr = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

b = [num for num in arr if num % 2 == 0]
print("a[] : ", arr)
print("b[] : ", b)
